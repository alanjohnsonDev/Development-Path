        <p>Hopefully, by now if you are reading this article, you know that I have been a Software Developer for about 5 months now.  Also, know that I have been 
            studying code to BECOME a Software Developer for over a year now.  Now, I am not trying to brag, but I want to tell the truth about the Tech world, specifically 
            towards Software Development.  Know that this is just my opinion, and only my opinion about the tech world from my point of view.</p>
        
        <p>I want to go through the Advantages and the Disadvantages of being in Tech.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">The Advantages</h4>

        <p>The tech world as a whole is a very lucrative industry.  So, once your into the industry know that the benefits will be great, money and raises will come your way, 
            and once you find that first position, its only UP from there.  I want to put this next point in the Advantages and Disadvantages of the tech industry, because some 
            people may love this part of the job and some might think its the hardest part.  Learning to code is very HARD and takes dedication most days of the week, so constant 
            learning of a new language or framework can be a struggle.  Now to me personally, its an Advantage because learning constantly gives you a bigger trajectory into new 
            positions at other companies or a raise into your current position.  I know there are a lot of advantages to tech, but I want to give one more big one that comes to mind.</p>

        <p>Having a like minded team, that has a great culture is a huge advantage in this industry.  I recently accepted a new opportunity to become a Software Developer at another company. 
            My last company I loved the culture, the team was amazing and I became so close with them that we would hang out after work sometimes.  At my current position, its the exact opposite.
            Unfortunately, culture can be a huge advantage or a harsh disadvantage.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">The Disadvantages</h4>
        
        <p>Gravitating towards the disadvantages of working in tech.  Like I said before this is my opinion and no one elses, so these could be advantages for some people. 
            My last position had a great culture, but I just didn't feel happy with the position due to the development we were making.  So, a disadvantage can be if you find a position,
            even if its in Software Development, just make sure it will be a niche that you enjoy.  I learned this from my past position, so please keep a close eye out for the job DESCRIPTION and 
            not just if you meet the requirements.</p> 

        <p>The other big disadvantage of working in the tech industry, I haven't experienced this myself, but layoffs.  Layoffs are a common theme in the tech industry, due to how well or how bad 
            a company is doing.  Unfortunately, the company will always look out for itself before its employees.  Please keep this in mind when trying to get into the tech industry.</p>
        
        <p>This article is not to scare you or hype up the Tech industry in any way, but its the truth through my eyes.  This last point goes for anyone out there trying to get a new job but are 
            afraid, because you want to be a loyal employee to your current company.  Think of it this way, your company your currently working at, if you quit to find another job they will find 
            another employee in a month for your position.  So, please don't stress about wanting to better yourself or wanting to achieve more by wanting a new position or career.</p>

        <p>Do what makes you feel happy, don't ever think your going to hurt your company you work for by leaving.</p>
        <p>Think of your mental health before anything else.  Self Love and Positivity.</p>
