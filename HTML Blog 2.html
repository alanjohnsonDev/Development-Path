        <p>Recently, I learned that being stuck in "tutorial hell",
            was the worst thing to hurt your career chances in
            Software Development.  Let me explain.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">What is Tutorial Hell?</h4>
        
        <p>Tutorial Hell is a statement that most Software Developers
            have found themselves in at the beginning stages of learning
            how to code.  What is tutorial hell?  This statement is referred
            to as a time in your new developer journey, where you are watching
            tutorials, able to follow along, and replicate what the instructor
            is doing and it works. But, this can lead to months on months of just
            watching tutorials and never being able to make your own projects,
            without help from those tutorials.  The only reason why I know this so well
            was because I was stuck in tutorial hell for 6-8 months without any end in
            sight. Do you feel this way? Want to learn how to get out?</p>
        
        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">How to Get Out of Tutorial Hell</h4>
        
        <p>Learning how to read Documentation is KEY! Reading Documentation means,
            instead of going back to YouTube or googling a video to learn how to do
            something when you get stuck, you sit down read the documentation for what
            is troubling you and finding a solution. Your probably asking yourself the
            same question I was asking myself when I learned about this trick,
            "Why does it matter if I read documentation or watch a video"?</p>
        
        <p>The real reason why we don't want to be stuck on video tutorials our whole
            career is due to the fact that learning how to google is a special skill
            to have when becoming a Software Developer.  Your boss or coworkers
            will be wondering why your pulling up a video to figure out a bug or problem
            in your code, instead of finding the documentation.  Now another big reason
            to start learning how to read documentation is due to the fact that most videos
            only cover the basics of certain languages, but documentation reaches down deep
            into the heart of the language or problem your struggling with in your code.</p>
           
        <p>Your probably asking now, "What is good sources to rely on for documentation"?</p> 
        
        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Reliable Documentation Sources</h4>

        <p>The top 5 reliable documentation sources are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>W3Schools</li>
            <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
            <li>Medium Articles</li>
            <li>GeeksforGeeks</li>
            <li>Stack Overflow</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you become a "great googler", when you look up troubleshooting questions,
            I would look for these websites first, because they have been the most reliable
            sources for my coding experience. W3Schools, will always be my top source to go
            to due to the fact that every question I have, usually pops up with a link to W3Schools
            and they nail my question with a great answer in 3 minutes of research.</p>

        <p>If you want to look up deep solutions to problems that might be harder to find,
            Stack Overflow can be helpful.  Stack Overflow is a forum created by developers
            to answer questions to any problems you might have, but take caution because
            this website can be toxic if you ask a generic or easier question to some of the
            developers on the forum.</p>
        
        <p>Medium Articles are a great find for generic to specific solutions to problems,
            just depends mainly on the author of the page. Free Code Camp and GeeksforGeeks
            are great resources to help you in with special syntax errors or learning how to
            code in general.</p>
        
        <p>To summarize, tutorial hell can be a hard stage to get out of early into your career path,
            but the quicker to step away from videos and tutorials and focus on documentation sources,
            the better.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Development Path: Challenge</h4>

        <p>The coding challenge I want you to conquer today is, create a small project using HTML,
            if you're already using CSS, provide CSS basics inside of this project.</p>

        <p>Don't use a tutorial video, use the sources I provided you today and google anything
            you might have trouble with. I know this might be hard at first, but the knowledge
            you will gain from this single small project will change your life. I promise.</p>

        <p>Don't expand on the project to much, make it a project you can start and finish in 
            a couple of hours or 1 day.</p><br>
