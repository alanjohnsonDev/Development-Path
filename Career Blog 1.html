        <p>In this article I want to go into some specifics on how I landed my first job in Tech.  
            Before I tell you about my tech interview, 
            I want to tell you about my resume and projects I completed to get the interview.
        </p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Resume</h4>
        
        <p>In my technology resume I decided to put my experience in tech, first.  Now, this wasn't a very long list of things, 
          knowing that I didn't have any real world experience.  The biggest thing I decided to put on my resume, was my GitHub account.  
          I have worked on a lot of projects that helped me gain my role as a Junior Software Developer.  These projects were very small 
          and only took me a few days to a week to complete.  The big thing was is that I finished every one of them, 
          before putting the final product on my GitHub page.  I know this might sound easy to most people, because you want to put your best foot forward, 
          but I had a very hard time finishing projects in my early stages of learning.  I was always a little nervous of finishing a project, 
          or I would find another project I wanted to start, so I decided to quit on others.</p>

        <p>Now I want to talk more about the projects, more than my resume.  Before I do that I want to tell you that if you are just starting out
          and really interested in making software development a career for yourself, then follow these guidelines for your resume.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Resume Tips</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Put ONLY things you feel confident about on your resume</li>
          <li>Gravitate towards languages you want to learn for your career</li>
          <li>Remember, your path is YOUR Path.  Don't let anyone discourage you if 
            you want to try out another language or technology.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Remember there are so many different fields and categories to go in for Tech.  
          You have Software Development, Game Development, AI, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Data Science, and so much more.  
          Please remember tech careers can be very lucrative, but you want to love what you do first!</p>
        
        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Projects on GitHub</h4> 

        <p>The projects on GitHub that impressed the Software Engineers in my interview were three different projects.  
          The first project was a Input Form.  Now I got lucky, because most of the development that is in my job deals
          with input forms and data science.  The best part about an input form is that it might take less than a few hours
          to make and it shows a lot of development behind it.  Input Forms show how to make classes, IDs, 
          and also spicing up the form with a little CSS.</p>

        <p>The second project was showing them a Landing Page I made for a friend, for her small business she was starting up.  
          This page was very simple, but thorough at the same time.  We collaborated together, thought of a good plan to help her
          business grow and the landing page is a hit for her great business idea.</p>

        <p>The last project was a passion project that I just started making, this website you're on right now.  
          <strong>Development Path</strong>, is my baby, the project that I wanted to start a year ago when I started to learn to code.
          I always had a big passion project in my mind that I just never got around to starting.  Mostly I was scared to do a passion project, 
          but in my interview it showed how much I loved software development to the development team.  Once I started the HTML for the project, 
          the rest of Development Path just came to me and I have being loving every second.</p>

        <p>I guess what I am trying to get at here is that you don't want to wait any longer to start your big passion project.  Please start now, 
          because it might just be your ticket into getting your first role as a Software Developer.</p>
