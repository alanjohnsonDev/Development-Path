        <p>When you finally gain the courage to start your first project on your own,
            which trust me was very hard for me, here are a few projects I started with
            to gain my knowledge early in coding.</p>

        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Tribute Page</h4>
        
        <p>The first project I ever made using HTML only was a <strong>Tribute Page</strong> on FreeCodeCamp.
            Before you get upset at me, I first made a FreeCodeCamp version with their criteria.
            After that I wanted to retain the knowledge, so I made my first Tribute page with my 
            favorite rapper, Logic.  The main reason why this project is great for beginners is that
            we are mainly only using HTML.  You will use some header tags, ordered/unordered lists,
            and maybe alittle CSS, but thats just to tidy things up a bit.  This was very crucial to me
            sustaining the knowledge and being able to move into other projects with more confidence.</p>
        
        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Survey Form</h4> 

        <p>The second project that pushed me to my next level was making a very simple <strong>Survey Form</strong>.  
            Once you use a tutorial to do this project, try this one on your own, only using documentation if you get stuck.
            I promise your first one might be hard and not very good, but do 5 different ones in a row, you will get good fast!  
            Once you get the hang of a Survey Form, you should be able to knock one out in 20 minutes.  The main part of a survey
            is making sure you know your "input" tags and classes that deal with HTML.  The rest we can customize with CSS once we
            get to that part.</p>
        
        <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Landing Page with Form</h4>
        
        <p>Landing Pages are just a "one page" website that users will hop to using a hyperlink.
            This project will take you a few days, but it will cover using anchor, "a", tags with your Navigation Bar,
            using ordered/unordered lists, paragraph tags, header tags, and finish up with a form.  
            This project will be a great stepping stone for you.  Not only will you use everything thats basic in HTML,
            but you can go further with image tags, diving into the basics of CSS, and much more.  Very soon you will
            have a beautiful landing page to be very proud about.</p>
            
        <p>These three projects will not only give you coding experience, but great resources to jump back to
            when you get stuck on future projects.  Trust me, it will happen, but its ok!  
            We all go back to past projects to see how we made a survey form, or using an anchor tag.  
            Coders are not good, because they remember everything, trust me no coder remembers everything.  
            A good coder knows when to look at past projects, or documentation to solve their problem FASTER.  
            At the end of the day, as Software Developers, we are here to solve problems!</p><br>
