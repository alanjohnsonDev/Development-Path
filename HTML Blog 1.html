        <p>So... you are wanting or learning how to code?  How is it going so far?
            Do you think you have the right path to take towards a career in 
            <em>Software Development</em>?  I want to give you a small back story of
            my path to becoming a Junior Software Developer.  Every week I will be posting
            an article about the steps to becoming a Software Developer.  If you want great
            information on a path to a career in <strong>tech</strong>, you found the right
            place.</p>
        
        <p>Lets start from the beginning.  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone
            of most websites.  This is the "content" portion of your website.  It can look 
            very bland, but can be very powerful.  Usually, your first step in learning will
            be HTML.  This language is the easiest to learn, while also being one of the most
            important languages to learn in your coding journey.  Start off learning the basics.
            In my journey,  FreeCodeCamp was my first stop to start learning how to code.
            Quincy Larson, the maker of FreeCodeCamp, made an entire FREE resource to learn how to code.
            It's actually mind blowing how useful this website really is for the beginner, intermediate,
            or expert in the field of tech.</p>
        
        <p><em>Consistency is KEY!</em> When it comes to coding to really retain what you're learning,
            staying consistent is a must.  At the beginning of my coding experience, I was only coding
            on the weekends, which wasn't helping me at all.  I was enjoying it, but unfortunately I was
            barely learning anything.  What helped me the most was to learn at least 1 hour per day, bare minimum.
            I know it sounds like alot, but if you really want a career in tech, make the sacrifice for your long-term
            happiness as a Software Developer.  Once I pushed myself to learn every single day, I was learning so much more
            in a smaller amount of time.  Its only 4% of your entire day, to learn 1 hour of code, YOU can do this!</p>
        
        <p>Last but not least, starting out I was searching for hours on YouTube and found hundreds of different videos on
            many different languages.  My advice is to start slow with HTML, gain the basics and fundamentals, then move on
            to advanced principles of HTML and basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) principles.</p>
            
        <p>Come back next week for more on HTML Basics.</p>
